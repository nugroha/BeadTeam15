# Rules on blood pressure
#===================================
# measure systolic and diastolic every morning :

# Hypertensive Crisis :
case ( systolic  >= 180 && diastolic >= 110 ) :
if bp lasted like this for at least half a day?

	alert patient that his current blood pressure is critical & he better go hospital immediately if he doesn't want to die
	alert doctor that patient is "hypertensive crisis" & award patient immediately for emergency care

# Hypertension Stage 2 :
case ( systolic  >= 160 && diastolic >= 100 ) :
if bp lasted like this for at least 2 days?

	alert patient that his current blood pressure is getting dangerously high & he better bloody do something about it if he doesn't want to die
	alert doctor that patient is "hypertension stage 2" & trigger urgent follow-up

# Hypertension Stage 1 :
case ( systolic  >= 140 && diastolic >= 90 ) :
if bp lasted like this for 3 consecutive days?
	alert patient that his blood pressure is getting higher & he better do something about it!
	alert doctor that patient is "hypertension stage 1" & trigger more frequent follow-up

#Prehypertension :
case ( systolic  >= 120 && diastolic >= 80 ) :
if bp lasted like this for 3 consecutive days
	alert patient on his current blood pressure & what should be the healthy range
	alert doctor that patient is "prehypertension" & to start monitoring patient

#Normal :
case ( systolic  < 120 && diastolic < 80 ) :
	praise patient? award "badges" after every week of good blood pressure?
	
#===================================
# Rules on medication, simplify to :
#====================================
# medication to be taken once a day every morning.
# and if patient skip medication for >= 2 days per week, will alert doctor.
# pillBoxDay = 1 each time pill box open, reset to 0 at end of the day
# daysWithoutMed = ++1 each time pillBoxDay = 0 at end of the day, daysWithoutMed reset to 0 at end of week

# send reminder 2x a day if patient never take medication :

#===================================
# Rules on heart rate zone
#===================================
# A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute.
# If it is consistently high >=100 per min, then it indicates an underlying problem.
# If a person is exercising, his target heart-rate zone needs to be within 
# 50% and 85% of one's maximum heart rate. 
# max heart rate = 220 - age

maxHR = 220 - age;
minHRZone = 0.5 * maxHR
maxHRZone = 0.85 * maxHR

# detect heartRate every 15 mins?
# store in tuple : (dateTimeStamp, HR)
prevHR = heartRate(6:45am)  #returns heartRate taken at 6:45am
tmpTime = 0 mins

For (time <- 7am to 11pm; loop every 15mins)
{

	If (currHR > 100)
	{
		tmpTime = tmpTime + 15mins
		
		#if currHR > 100 we assume patient has started exercising...
		#If he's exercising, his currentHR should be < maxHR, otherwise dangerous!
		#Or if heartrate is consistently > 100 for more than an hr, then dangerous!

		if ( (currHR > maxHRZone) or (tmpTime > 60mins) )
			alert patient on his excessive heart rate, ask him not to over exert!
			display his target zone (minHRZone, maxHRZone)
			and if he's not exercising currently, he should see a doctor immediately!
